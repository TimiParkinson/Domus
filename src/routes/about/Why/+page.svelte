        <h1>Los Angeles Housing Crisis</h1>
        <p>In the heart of Los Angeles, a devastating housing crisis is unfolding. Skyrocketing rent prices, limited affordable housing, and growing income inequality have pushed thousands of residents to the brink of homelessness. Families struggle to find stable housing, while young professionals and long-time community members are forced out of neighborhoods they've called home for generations.</p>
